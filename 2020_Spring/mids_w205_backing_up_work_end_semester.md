### MIDS w205 - Backing up your work at the end of the semester

#### GitHub classroom repos

GitHub classroom will delete all repos in the mids-w205-crook organization on GitHub.  This includes the repos for course content and projects 1, 2, and 3. 

If you forked a repo into the mids-w205-crook organization, the fork will also be deleted.

If you forked a repo in the mids-w205-crook organizatio into your own organization, I'm not sure if it will be deleted or not.  GitHub classroom does not have any documentation that seems to address this, and I don't have a way to test it.   You can fork a repo in the mids-w205-crook organization to your own organization, but I would recommend that you also make another backup of it.

#### Your VM in the GCP

Your virtual machine (VM) in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) will not go away, unless you delete it.  

The w205 directory should have all of your work for the semester, including course content, and your repos for projects 1, 2, and 3, and your weekly in class directories.  

However, I would suggest that you make a backup using one of the methods detailed in the following sections.
