# Suggestions for Assignment 7 for MIDS W205 2018 Summer - Kevin Crook

Part of the Berkeley culture is to not place any limits on student success.  In keeping with this culture, there are open ended components of this assignment to allow students to synthesize what they learned in the assignment to take it to higher levels.  

I would like to keep it as open ended as possible, however, I understand students have skipped some of the minimum steps in the past, so I wanted to provide a checklist of minimum components. I'm also providing a list of suggested enhancements.

## Minimum components

The following are the minimum components that I would be looking for in terms of a 9 (A):

* Include the yml file as a separate file checked into GitHub in addition to the annotations file.

While the format is open ended, here are some suggestions for what students have done in the past:

* Everything professionally formatted in markdown.

* Annotate the architecture as defined in the yml file.  Describe each container and what it does.

* For each step, include a header, sentences to describe the step, and the step.  If the step is long, you may want to show it multi-line as I do in mine.

* For each step, if the output is brief, include it.  If the output is mult-page, include a few lines of the most meaningful output.

* For json files, pull out an individual json object and show it as an example of what the file looks like.

* For csv files, pull out the header and a couple of lines to show it as an example of what the file looks like.

* 


## Suggestions for enhancements

Enhancements are totally open ended, so feel free to add any enhancements you wish, as I do not want to place any limits on your success.  You would need to do substantial enhancements above the minimum in terms of a 10 (A+):
