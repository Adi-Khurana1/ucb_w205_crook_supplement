### UCB MIDS W205 - Kevin Crook's supplement for Synchronous Session #7

We will try to follow the official slides as close as we can in class.  I will post commands here to make them easier for students to copy and paste.

#### Checklist before class and before working on assignments

Right now, this checklist has things in it we haven't covered yet, so just do what we have covered.
