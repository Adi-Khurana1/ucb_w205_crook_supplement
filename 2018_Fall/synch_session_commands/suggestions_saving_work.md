## Suggestions for saving your work after the GitHub repos and Digital Ocean droplets (virtual machines) go away at the end of the semester

At the end of the semester, you GitHub repos and your Digital Ocean droplets (virtual machines) will go away.

The Docker images are stored on Docker Hub and they will NOT go away, so you can re-run the clusters that we built.  

### Here is a list of suggested ways to save your work (with detailed instructions to follow):

* For Windows users, make a zip file in the droplet, use WinSCP to copy the zip file down to your Windows PC, upzip, and verify that everything looks ok

* For Mac or Linux users, make a tar ball (a tar file that is compress with gzip), use scp to copy the tar ball down to your Mac or Linux machine, extract the tar ball, and verify that everything looks ok

* On your laptop, you can download either the Windows or Mac GitHub app and clone down all of your repos.  This will of course only copy repos
